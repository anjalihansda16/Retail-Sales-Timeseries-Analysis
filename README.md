## Project Overview
I work at **Insight Nexus**, a market research and consulting firm specializing in providing data-driven insights for businesses and startups. Recently, a clothing startup approached us to conduct a **time series analysis** of men’s and women’s clothing sales in the U.S. market. Their goal is to gain a deep understanding of market trends, seasonality, and consumer behavior to make informed decisions regarding their market entry.

## Key Responsibilities
For this project, I assumed multiple roles to mimic a real-world scenario:
1. **Data Engineer**: I set up an **ETL pipeline** using **Python** for data cleaning and loading, ensuring that the data was transformed into an analysis-ready format and stored in a **database**.
2. **Data Analyst**: I performed **time series analysis** using **SQL** to extract and analyze the data, and used **Excel** to create **visualizations** to help identify trends, seasonality, and consumer behavior.
3. **Data Team Lead**: I planned the project, took ownership of the business problem document, and managed task delegation between different roles involved in the project.


### Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

├── visualizations/           # Output visualizations (charts, graphs) from analysis
├── docs/                     # Documentation files including business problem and project plan
│   ├── project_plan.md       # Initial project plan and scope
│   ├── business_problem.md   # Detailed business problem document
├── ppt/                      # Final presentation in PowerPoint
├── README.md                 # Project overview and repository guide

## Project Scope
- **Data Range**: January 1992 to January 2020.
- **Geography**: U.S. retail market for men’s and women’s clothing.

## Future Scope
1. Advanced machine learning techniques to forecast future sales trends.
2. Integration with external datasets (e.g., economic indicators) to enhance the analysis.

## Conclusion
This project was a virtual initiative where I took on multiple responsibilities, simulating a real-world project. I setting up ETL pipelines, timeseries data analysis and planning a project to tackle the business problem.
