**Time Series Analysis of U.S. Retail Clothing Market for Startup Market Entry**

#### Project Overview:
A clothing startup Trendline Apparel Co. aiming to enter the U.S. market has approached our market research and consulting company for valuable insights into the retail clothing industry. Specifically, the startup seeks a comprehensive time series analysis of men's and women's clothing sales from 1992 to 2020. The goal is to understand market trends, seasonality, consumer behavior, and other key factors that may influence retail performance, enabling the startup to make informed decisions on market entry, product offerings, and pricing strategies.
